# Discord Arcade
![Hack Club Discord Icon](docs/images/HackClubDiscordIcon.png)

Who says the arcade is only for those who use slack? With the arcade discord bot, you can bridge the two together

Control your arcade sessions through the bot, using the commands such as

- /start
- /history
- /recent

...and more!

You can install the bot through [this](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1259150189122424934&permissions=534723816528&integration_type=0&scope=bot+applications.commands) discord invite link

# Usage

![Usage of the /start command](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1acac6ce-fd44-43c8-ad14-39a3b75f3e1e)

This will create a discord thread, where you can inteact with the bot in a controlled environment
